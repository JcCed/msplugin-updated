# msplugin-updated
Updated MSPlugin for Blender 4.3.x. Adjusted from original MSPlugin provided by QUIXEL AB. 👍

## What is Working and what changed?
- Works with Blender 4.3.2 at the moment
- The import of materials from the Bridge app to Blender
- The rest might work too, but I didn't check that 😁

## Setup
1. In the Export Settings in the Bridge app, set the ***Export Target*** to "Custom Socket Export" and the ***Socket Port*** to "24981".
2. Put the `__init__.py` file in "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.3\scripts\startup\MSPlugin".

## Notes
- I just reworked the original plugin from QUIXEL AB  👍

Thanks! 😊
